This is a test document to verify that DocuGenius correctly uses the new "DocuGenius" folder name instead of "kb".

The extension should automatically copy this file to the DocuGenius/ folder when auto-conversion is enabled.

Test content:
- Feature 1: Document conversion
- Feature 2: Folder organization  
- Feature 3: Backward compatibility

This test verifies that the default folder name has been successfully changed from "kb" to "DocuGenius".
